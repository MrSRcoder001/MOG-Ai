🤖 MOG AI – Voice Assistant (Web-Based)

MOG AI is a web-based AI voice assistant built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to interact with their computer using voice commands.
It can perform tasks like opening apps, accessing system settings, using camera & microphone, browsing the web, and responding intelligently using AI logic.

⚠️ Note: Due to browser security restrictions, direct system-level access is handled via permissions, APIs, or backend integration.

🌐 Open websites using voice commands

⚙️ Access system-related actions (via browser permissions)

📷 Camera & Microphone access

🧠 AI-style command understanding

💻 Clean & responsive UI

🧠 How It Works

User clicks Start Listening

Microphone permission requested

Voice converted to text using SpeechRecognition API

Command processed using JavaScript logic

Assistant responds using SpeechSynthesis API

Browser performs allowed action

🔐 Permissions Used

🎤 Microphone (voice input)

📷 Camera (camera access)

🌍 Internet (search & browsing)

MOG AI does NOT access system files directly without user permission.

🧩 Limitations

Browser sandbox limits full OS control

System apps opening depends on OS & browser

Advanced system control requires backend (Node.js / Electron)

🔮 Future Enhancements

🔗 Node.js / Electron integration for full system control

🤖 AI (ChatGPT / Gemini API) integration

🧠 NLP-based smart commands

🌙 Dark mode

📱 Mobile PWA support

🔐 User authentication
